# NSABot
A Discord.js bot that logs everything sent to it or anything sent in a server that has it!

# Installing

Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/Sixthhokage1/NSABot.git`

In the NSABot directory, run `npm install`

[Register an app with Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create), add a bot user to the app, and copy the user token for the bot into bot.js. Also on the Discord application settings for the bot user click the OAuth URL generator to create a link to add the bot to your server.

# Running
Start the bot with `node bot.js`. It will now output all messages it sees to stdout.
